Welcome to my blog!

This is the start of something great. I have learned a lot about programming and tech and I find myself wanting to share what I've learned with others. One of the greatest joys in my life is seeing someone grasp a concept that they struggled with and that I am explaining to them.

I am a strong advocate for the next generation of programmers, lifelong learners, teachers, and tech geeks. The future of society will be very driven by technology, and if we make technology and programming accessible to anyone, it ensures a better future for everyone.

If you have any thoughts about what kind of tech-related content I should cover in my blog, please leave a comment below. Otherwise, enjoy!
