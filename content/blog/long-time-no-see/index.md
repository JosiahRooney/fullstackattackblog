It's been a long hiatus but I'm finally back and ready to continue updating this blog. A lot has changed in the last year. Right now, as most everyone on earth is doing, I'm sheltering at home because of the Coronavirus. Thankfully, I have been largely unaffected by the virus. Just at the end of 2019 I accepted a new position with a fully remote company called Zenlist. I am part of a small distributed team that has weathered the shelter in place order rather well, since we all work from home anyway. I'm excited to be part of the team and to see what cool stuff we can build together.

At work, I'm using a set of tools that I've wanted to use professionally for a long time. Our front end stack is React, TypeScript, GraphQL, Apollo, and a handful of closely related tools. TypeScript has been fascinating to adopt. It was hard to get used to the rigidity of it but I have. Now I see how it is allowing me to code faster, experiencing fewer runtime bugs as a result of the strictness of the language.

I've decided to get back into this blog to help keep me occupied while I spend so much time at home. I have learned so much in the last year and I can't wait to post all about it!

Future posts:

* How to use a callback to pass data from the component that renders a child
* How to write custom React hooks
* How to use Intersection Observer API with React functional components

Stay tuned!

Let me know if you have any ideas or questions that I can answer with future posts!
